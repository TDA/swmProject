Cons:
1. Throwing numbers at us, am i supposed to be impressed? 6 times??
2. Novel/New classes of errors? Like seriously?
3. Commutativity is once again, just bad coding. Not really a vulnerability.
4. Unit testing ok? Integration testing not ok? lets ship it anyway.
5. Trying to build a tool to correct the mistakes they made in the first tool. Not really rocket science.
6. Sufficient engineering work? With sufficient engineering work I could build the sistine chapel.
7. No 'statiscally' significant overhead.
8. Potentially not sound!
9. Policy!!!
